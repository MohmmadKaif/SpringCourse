***********************************This Is Our Spring Tutorial Project********************************************

Now in this example we have Demonstrated Constructor Dependency Injection.
In setter injection we do not have to call setter methods explicitly as done in traditional java programming practicse. 
Instead the setter is called by spring container itself.
This is known as Setter injection.


***************************************IMPORTANT**************************************************************
Remember that the spring container will run the setter for the all specified beans in the applicationContext.xml
Thus all the beans where we have injected the setter class will run the setter class.
Run this program and you will understand.
